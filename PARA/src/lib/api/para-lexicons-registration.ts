/**
 * Para Lexicon Registration
 *
 * The published @atproto/api npm package does not include PARA's custom
 * lexicons (com.para.*).  agent.call() validates every method against the
 * agent's internal Lexicons collection and throws "Lexicon not found" if the
 * schema is missing.  This helper registers all PARA lexicons at runtime so
 * civic and community XRPC calls work in the PARA app.
