# PARA Server Firewall Setup
# =============================================================================
# Configures UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) for a PARA production server.
# Blocks everything except SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
#
# WARNING: Run this script AFTER you have verified SSH access works.
# If you block SSH by mistake, you'll lock yourself out of the server.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./scripts/setup-firewall.sh
#
# For the 2-computer split, run this on BOTH Computer A and Computer B.
# Computer A (Edge) allows 80/443.
# Computer B (Compute) allows ONLY traffic from Computer A's IP.
